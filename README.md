# PHP Employee Management System

## Introduction
This project represents my initial attempt to learn web development using PHP. It is a simple Employee Management System that showcases basic functionalities of handling data in a web application.

## Project Overview
The Employee Management System is designed to manage employee records using PHP and MySQL. This application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee data, providing a practical example of integrating PHP with a MySQL database.

## Technologies Used
- **PHP**: Server-side scripting language used to handle server requests and database interaction.
- **MySQL**: Database system used for storing employee records.
- **JavaScript**: Enhances user interaction with dynamic content.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the web pages.

## Features
- **User Registration and Login System**: Secure user authentication for managing sessions.
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can add, view, edit, and delete employee records.
- **Profile Management**: Users can update their profile information.

## Files in the Repository
- `ajax.php`: Handles AJAX requests.
- `config.php`: Database configuration settings.
- `database.php`: Database connection and operations.
- `form.php`, `index.php`, `login.php`, `logout.php`, `profile.php`, `register.php`, `tabledata.php`, `user.php`: These PHP files provide the user interface and backend functionalities for various aspects of the system.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a MySQL database using the provided configurations in `config.php`.
3. Run the application on a local server (e.g., XAMPP).

## How to Use
- Start by registering a new user or logging in with existing credentials.
